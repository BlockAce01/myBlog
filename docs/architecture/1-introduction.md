# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the Personal Tech Blog, including the backend microservices, frontend implementation, and their integration. It is the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack. This architecture is designed to fulfill the requirements of the PRD and the visual goals of the UI/UX Specification, with a primary focus on creating a showcase of modern DevOps and full-stack development practices.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

*   **Frontend:** The project will be built upon the AI-generated Next.js/React codebase provided by the user, which is located in the `apps/frontend` directory of the monorepo. This code serves as our validated UI foundation.
*   **Backend:** All backend microservices will be created from scratch (greenfield).
