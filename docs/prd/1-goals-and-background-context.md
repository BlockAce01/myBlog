# 1. Goals and Background Context

### Goals

*   To tangibly demonstrate practical skills in a high-demand MERN stack and modern DevOps toolchain.
*   To create a compelling, living portfolio piece that stands out to tech recruiters and hiring managers.
*   To secure a high-quality internship in a DevOps, Full-Stack, or AI/ML-focused role.
*   To share knowledge with the tech community, establishing a professional brand and online presence.

### Background Context

For aspiring IT professionals, a traditional resume often fails to capture the depth of their practical abilities. This project addresses that gap by creating a personal tech blog that is, in itself, a demonstration of skill. The platform serves as a public showcase for the author's journey through challenges like KodeKloud's "100 Days of DevOps," explorations into AI/ML, and real-world problem-solving.

The strategic choice to build this platform using a microservice architecture on the MERN stack, with a fully automated CI/CD pipeline on AWS, transforms a simple content site into a powerful narrative. It allows recruiters not just to read about the author's knowledge, but to see the functional, deployed result of that knowledge, providing verifiable proof of their capabilities in a competitive internship market.
