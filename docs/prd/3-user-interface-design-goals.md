# 3. User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The user experience will be clean, professional, and content-focused. The design should be minimalist and uncluttered, ensuring that the blog content is highly readable and that the site is fast-loading. The overall impression should be that of a competent, modern, and detail-oriented developer.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
The interaction model will be straightforward and intuitive, following established web conventions. The primary user journey is content discovery and consumption. The interface will be built with a mobile-first, responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices, from mobile phones to widescreen desktops.

### Core Screens and Views
1.  **Homepage (Blog List):** A clean, scannable list of all blog posts, each with a clear title, publication date, summary, and view count.
2.  **Blog Post Detail Page:** A typography-focused layout designed for optimal readability of long-form technical content. Will include the article body and its view count.
3.  **About Page:** A simple, professional page to present your bio, skills, and contact information.
4.  **Admin Post Management View (Private):** A functional, secure interface for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog posts.

### Accessibility
*   **WCAG AA:** The public-facing website will adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standard. This is a crucial indicator of a well-rounded and considerate developer.

### Branding
*   The site will feature a minimalist, tech-inspired theme with a strong emphasis on typography. A professional color palette will be used, with an **optional dark mode** to appeal to the target tech audience.

### Target Device and Platforms
*   **Web Responsive:** The application must be fully functional and visually appealing on all modern web browsers and device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
