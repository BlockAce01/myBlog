Pay special attention to creating a clean, professional, and minimalist aesthetic that is content-focused and adheres to WCAG AA accessibility standards."

### Architect Prompt
"The PRD for the Personal Tech Blog is complete. Once the UI/UX Specification is ready, create the comprehensive `fullstack-architecture.md`. The architecture must implement the specified MERN stack, a microservices backend, and the full DevOps toolchain (Terraform, Ansible, Docker, GitHub Actions) for deployment on AWS."
