# Epic 1: Local Full-Stack Development & Verification

**Epic Goal:** To have a complete, locally runnable, and testable public-facing blog application, orchestrated with Docker Compose.

**Stories:**

*   **Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding:** Create the GitHub monorepo with the initial apps/ and packages/ structure.
*   **Story 1.2: Backend Services Scaffolding:** Create the initial Express.js application skeletons for the Blog Service and the Analytics Service.
*   **Story 1.3: Data Models & Database Connection:** Define the Mongoose schemas for BlogPosts, Comments, and Tags, and establish the connection to a local MongoDB instance.
*   **Story 1.4: Implement All Public Backend APIs:** Build and test all the public-facing API endpoints for posts, comments, likes, view counts, and tag filtering across the relevant microservices.
*   **Story 1.5: Frontend Application Scaffolding:** (Done) Set up the React application in the apps/web directory.
*   **Story 1.6: Implement All Public UI Features:** (Done) Build the complete user interface for the homepage, blog post detail page (with Markdown rendering and syntax highlighting), the "About Me" page, and the UI for likes, comments, and tag filtering.
*   **Story 1.7: Frontend-Backend Integration:** Connect the frontend UI with the backend APIs to ensure full application functionality.
*   **Story 1.8: Local Multi-Container Setup:** Create a docker-compose.yml file to easily run the entire full-stack application (frontend, all backend services, and a MongoDB database) locally with a single command (docker-compose up).
