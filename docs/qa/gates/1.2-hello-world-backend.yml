summary: |
  The implementation of Story 1.2, "Hello World" Backend Service," is complete and meets all defined acceptance criteria. The backend service correctly exposes a `/` endpoint returning `{"message": "Hello World"}` with a `200 OK` status. The integration into `index.js` is correct, and a comprehensive test suite has been implemented using Jest and Supertest, which passes successfully. The developer agent has also proactively handled port conflicts by adjusting the application's listening port.
