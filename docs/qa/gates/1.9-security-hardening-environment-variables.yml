# QA Gate: Story 1.9 - Security Hardening - Environment Variables
# Epic: 1 - Local Full Stack Development and Verification
# Review Date: 2025-09-13
# QA Agent: Quinn (Test Architect & Quality Advisor)

# Gate Decision
decision: FAIL
reason: Critical security breach - MongoDB credentials exposed in version control

# Risk Assessment
risk_level: CRITICAL
probability: HIGH
impact: CRITICAL
risk_score: 9/10

# Security Findings
security_issues:
  - type: credential_exposure
    severity: CRITICAL
    description: MongoDB URI with live credentials committed to Git
    evidence:
      - file: .env
      - username: yuganPaka
      - password: 7P9VQ20Fvj3pfztn
    impact: Complete database access compromise
    mitigation_required: IMMEDIATE

# Requirements Traceability
requirements_coverage:
  - requirement: "MongoDB URI credentials are removed from docker-compose.yml"
    status: PASS
    evidence: docker-compose.yml uses env_file directive
  - requirement: "Credentials are stored in environment variables"
    status: PASS
    evidence: MONGODB_URI defined in .env file
  - requirement: "Application continues to work with environment-based configuration"
    status: PASS
    evidence: docker-compose.yml properly configured
  - requirement: "No sensitive data is committed to version control"
    status: FAIL
    evidence: .env file with live credentials in Git history

# Test Results
test_execution:
  configuration_validation:
    status: PASS
    details: docker-compose.yml and .env properly configured
  git_exclusion_verification:
    status: PASS
    details: .gitignore excludes .env files
  credential_exposure_check:
    status: FAIL
    details: Live credentials found in Git commit history
  database_connectivity:
    status: PASS
    details: Application connects successfully with environment variables

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  - Implement automated secret detection in CI/CD pipeline
  - Use environment-specific credential management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
  - Add security training for credential handling
  - Implement zero-trust credential rotation policies
  - Add environment validation tests to prevent regression

# Next Steps
next_steps:
  - Block all deployments until remediation complete
  - Schedule security incident review meeting
  - Update security procedures documentation
  - Implement monitoring for similar exposures

# Approval Requirements
requires_approval_from:
  - Security Team Lead
  - DevOps Team Lead
  - Project Manager

# Re-review Date
re_review_required: true
re_review_date: 2025-09-14 (after remediation completion)
