  notes: |
    The implementation of Story 2.3 is complete and well-executed. All acceptance criteria have been met, and the code adheres to good practices for a Node.js/Express/Mongoose application.
    - BlogPost Schema: Correctly defined with all required fields and optional fields.
    - Backend Setup: Properly initializes the Express app, connects to MongoDB, and integrates the postsRouter.
    - CRUD Endpoints: All endpoints (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) are correctly implemented with validation and error handling.
    - Tests: Comprehensive test suite using supertest and mongodb-memory-server, covering all CRUD operations, including success cases, missing required fields, post not found, and invalid ID format.
    Overall, the implementation is robust, well-tested, and meets all specified requirements.
