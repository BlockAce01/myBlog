story_title: Implement Blog Post Search Bar
reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect & Quality Advisor)
date: 2025-09-16
overall_assessment: The implementation of the blog post search bar fully meets all specified acceptance criteria and adheres to project standards.
detailed_findings:
  frontend:
    - The search input field correctly replaces the "Recent Posts" heading and description.
    - The `useDebounce` hook is correctly implemented and integrated, providing a 300ms debounce for search queries.
    - Search results are displayed in the existing `PostCard` grid.
    - Search functionality works seamlessly with existing tag filters, with `getPosts` and `searchPosts` in `data.ts` correctly handling tag parameters.
    - Loading indicators (`Skeleton` components) are displayed during data fetching.
    - The count of search results is accurately displayed.
    - Appropriate empty states are shown when no results are found.
  backend:
    - A new API endpoint `GET /api/posts/search?q={query}&tag={tag}` has been successfully implemented.
    - The endpoint correctly utilizes MongoDB's text search (`$text: { $search: q }`) across `title`, `summary`, `content`, and `tags` fields, as enabled by the text index in `BlogPost.js`.
    - The endpoint correctly filters by `status: 'published'` and optionally by `tag`.
    - Error handling is present in API calls.
