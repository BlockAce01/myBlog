# Story: Full Production Preparation

**Status**: Approved
**Epic**: 2 - Secure Admin Interface (Local)
**Priority**: Critical

## User Story
As the lead developer
I need to prepare all systems for production deployment
So that we can launch a secure, maintainable application

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All test/sample data removed from frontend and backend
- [ ] Environment variables centralized with .env.example templates
- [ ] Zero hardcoded credentials or API keys in codebase
- [ ] All API endpoints use environment variables
- [ ] Production database configured with proper security
- [ ] Updated documentation for production setup
- [ ] Passes security audit for production readiness

## Technical Tasks
### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Create unified .env management system
- [ ] Replace hardcoded URLs with `process.env` variables
- [ ] Implement environment validation (frontend/backend)
- [ ] Create .env.example templates with documentation

### Database Migration
- [ ] Provision production MongoDB Atlas cluster
- [ ] Migrate data from test to production database
- [ ] Update connection strings in all services
- [ ] Implement database backup strategy
- [ ] Verify production DB security settings

### Code Cleanup
- [ ] Remove all test routes and sample data
- [ ] Audit for hardcoded values (API keys, credentials)
- [ ] Remove development-only features and logs
- [ ] Standardize error handling for production

### Documentation
- [ ] Update README with production setup
- [ ] Create deployment checklist
- [ ] Document environment variable requirements
- [ ] Add production troubleshooting guide

## Dev Notes
### Critical Implementation Details
- **Environment Variables**: Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` for frontend API calls
- **Database**: Migrate to dedicated production cluster (MongoDB Atlas)
- **Security**: All credentials must be env-based (no hardcoded values)
- **Structure**: Follow project conventions from [architecture docs](docs/architecture/7-unified-project-structure-source-tree.md)

### Architecture References
- [Tech Stack](docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md)
- [Data Models](docs/architecture/4-data-models.md)
- [API Specification](docs/architecture/5-api-specification-rest.md)

## Testing Requirements
- Verify all functionality with production env variables
- Test database connection with production credentials
- Security scan for sensitive data exposure
- End-to-end test of critical user flows
