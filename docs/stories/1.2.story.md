### Story

As a developer, I want to create the initial Express.js application skeleton for the backend service, so that we have a foundation for building the API.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new `backend` application is created inside the `apps` directory.
2.  The `backend` application is a Node.js project with Express.js installed.
3.  The application has a basic file structure as defined in the architecture.
4.  A "hello world" endpoint is available at `/api/hello` that returns a JSON object with a `message` property.
5.  The "hello world" endpoint has a corresponding unit test.

### Dev Notes

*   **Project Structure**: The backend will be a single application, as per `docs/architecture/7-unified-project-structure-source-tree.md`. The different "services" (blog, analytics) will be implemented as modules within this single application.
*   **Tech Stack**: Use Node.js and Express.js as defined in `docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md`.
*   **API**: The initial endpoint will be `/api/hello` as a proof of life.

### Tasks / Subtasks

*   [x] **Task 1: Create Backend Application Directory**
    *   [x] Create the `apps/backend` directory.

*   [x] **Task 2: Initialize Node.js Project**
    *   [x] Run `pnpm init -y` inside `apps/backend`.
    *   [x] Install `express` as a dependency.
    *   [x] Install `jest` and `supertest` as dev dependencies.

*   [x] **Task 3: Create Directory Structure**
    *   [x] Create the `apps/backend/src` directory.
    *   [x] Create the `apps/backend/src/api`, `apps/backend/src/services`, and `apps/backend/src/models` directories.

*   [x] **Task 4: Create "Hello World" Endpoint**
    *   [x] Create `apps/backend/src/index.js` and set up a basic Express server.
    *   [x] Create `apps/backend/src/api/hello.js` with a GET endpoint at `/` that returns `{ message: 'Hello, world!' }`.
    *   [x] Mount the `hello.js` router in `index.js` at the `/api/hello` path.

*   [x] **Task 5: Create Unit Test**
    *   [x] Create `apps/backend/src/api/hello.test.js`.
    *   [x] Write a test that uses `supertest` to make a GET request to `/api/hello` and asserts that the response is a 200 OK with the correct JSON body.

### QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation for the "hello world" endpoint is functional and the tests pass. All previously identified issues have been addressed.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✓]
- Project Structure: [✓]
- Testing Strategy: [✓]
- All ACs Met: [✓]

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] **Scope:** The implementation no longer includes `postsRouter` and MongoDB connection.
- [x] **Dependencies:** `jest` and `supertest` are now correctly categorized as `devDependencies` in `apps/backend/package.json`.
- [x] **Response Message:** The response message in `apps/backend/src/api/hello.js` is now "Hello, world!" (with a comma) matching the acceptance criteria.
- [x] **Tasks:** All tasks in the story file have been checked off.
