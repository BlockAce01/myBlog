# Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a properly structured monorepo,
**so that** I can manage the frontend, backend services, and shared packages in an organized and scalable way.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new GitHub repository is created.
2. The repository is initialized as a monorepo (e.g., using `npm workspaces`).
3. The directory structure with `apps/` and `packages/` folders is created.
4. Base linter and TypeScript configurations are set up for the workspace.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1 (AC: 2, 3): Initialize npm workspaces and create directory structure.
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Run `npm init -y` in the root.
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Modify `package.json` to include workspaces for `apps/*` and `packages/*`.
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Create `apps` and `packages` directories.
  - [x] Subtask 1.4: Add placeholder `README.md` files to `apps` and `packages`.
- [x] Task 2 (AC: 4): Set up base linting and TypeScript.
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Install `eslint` and `typescript` as root dev dependencies.
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Create a base `tsconfig.json` in the root.
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Create a base `.eslintrc.json` in the root.

### Completion Notes List
- The `apps` directory already existed and contained a frontend and backend application.
- The `packages` directory was created.
- A placeholder `README.md` was added to the `packages` directory only, to avoid interfering with existing applications in `apps`.
- Encountered and resolved a peer dependency conflict when installing dev dependencies by using the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag.

### File List
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `packages/README.md`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `.eslintrc.json`
