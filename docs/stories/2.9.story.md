# Story: Implement Secure Admin Authentication with Public/Private Key

**Status**: Ready for Review
**Epic**: 2 - Secure Admin Interface (Local)
**Priority**: Critical

## User Story
As the blog admin,
I want to authenticate using public/private key cryptography and have exclusive control over CRUD operations,
So that my admin account is protected against attacks and I can securely integrate with n8n workflows

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Password-based admin authentication completely removed
- [ ] New endpoint for generating key pairs implemented
- [ ] Challenge-response authentication flow implemented
- [ ] Admin dashboard with key management interface
- [ ] Private keys never leave client devices
- [ ] Google OAuth remains for regular users
- [ ] Comprehensive tests covering new auth flow
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented on authentication endpoints
- [ ] Key rotation mechanism implemented
- [ ] Only admin can create, update, or delete blog posts and manage site functions
- [ ] API access keys for n8n with scoped permissions
- [ ] Audit logs for all admin actions
- [ ] IP allowlisting for admin endpoints
- [ ] MFA option for critical operations

## Technical Tasks
### Backend Implementation
- [x] Add publicKey field to User model
- [x] Create /admin/keygen endpoint for key pair generation

- [ ] Remove password-based admin registration/login endpoints
- [x] Add rate limiting to authentication endpoints
- [ ] Implement key rotation mechanism
- [ ] Update JWT token generation for key-based auth

### Authorization System
- [x] Create adminOnly middleware for all CRUD routes
- [x] Add permission field to User model

- [ ] Add CSRF protection to key management endpoints
- [ ] Implement proper CORS configuration for admin endpoints

### Advanced Protections
- [x] Implement IP allowlisting middleware
- [ ] Add audit logging to MongoDB change streams
- [ ] Create suspicious activity alert system
- [x] Add TOTP-based MFA option

## Dev Notes
### Critical Implementation Details
- **Key Generation**: Use ECDSA P-256 curve for key pairs (widely supported)
- **Challenge Format**: Random 32-byte nonce with timestamp for replay protection
- **Signature Algorithm**: ECDSA with SHA-256
- **Key Storage**: Private keys stored in browser's IndexedDB, never transmitted
- **Session Management**: JWT tokens with shorter expiration for admin sessions
- **Rate Limiting**: 5 attempts per minute per IP for auth endpoints
- **RBAC**: AdminOnly middleware for CRUD operations. User model to include `permissions` array.
- **n8n API Keys**: HMAC-signed requests, key rotation, scoped access.
- **IP Allowlisting**: Restrict admin endpoints to known IPs.
- **Audit Logging**: MongoDB change streams + Elasticsearch.
- **MFA**: TOTP-based 2FA for critical operations.

- [API Specification](docs/architecture/5-api-specification-rest.md)
- [Security Requirements](docs/prd/7-epic-2-secure-admin-interface-local.md)

### Security Considerations
- Private keys must never be transmitted to server
- All cryptographic operations happen client-side
- Server only stores/verifies public keys
- Challenge-response prevents replay attacks
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- RBAC ensures only authorized users perform actions
- API key signing protects n8n integration
- IP allowlisting adds network-level security
- Audit logging provides traceability
- MFA adds an extra layer of user authentication

## Testing Requirements
### Unit Tests
- Key pair generation and validation
- Challenge-response flow
- Signature verification
- Rate limiting functionality
- Error handling for invalid keys
- RBAC middleware
- API key generation and validation
- HMAC signature verification

### Integration Tests
- Complete authentication flow
- Key rotation process
- Session management
- Error scenarios (invalid signatures, expired challenges)
- Admin CRUD operations with RBAC
- n8n workflow integration with API keys
- IP allowlisting enforcement
- MFA flow

### Security Tests
- Attempt to bypass authentication with invalid keys
- Test rate limiting effectiveness
- Verify private keys are not transmitted
- Test replay attack prevention
- Attempt unauthorized CRUD operations
- Test API key bypass attempts
- Test IP allowlisting bypass
- Test MFA bypass

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-18

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: FAIL - Critical Security Violations**

The implementation contains fundamental security flaws that violate the core requirements of the story. The cryptographic authentication system transmits private keys from server to client, directly contradicting the requirement that "Private keys never leave client devices."

### Refactoring Performed

None performed - security issues require coordinated architectural changes that cannot be safely refactored without breaking existing functionality and requiring frontend/backend synchronization.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✓/✗] ✓ - Code follows project conventions
- Project Structure: [✓/✗] ✓ - Files organized according to architecture
- Testing Strategy: [✓/✗] ✗ - No tests implemented for security-critical auth system
- All ACs Met: [✓/✗] ✗ - Multiple ACs not implemented or incorrectly implemented

### Security Review

**CRITICAL ISSUES:**
- Server-side key generation violates "private keys never leave client devices" requirement
- Private key transmission over network creates man-in-the-middle vulnerability
- Implementation contradicts stated security principles in component descriptions

**MODERATE ISSUES:**
- No CSRF protection on key management endpoints
- Session invalidation on key change not implemented
- Password-based auth still present in User model (not removed as required)

**MINOR ISSUES:**
- Challenge storage noted as "temporary" with TODO for Redis
- No key rotation mechanism implemented

### Performance Considerations

- Cryptographic operations properly isolated to client-side
- Rate limiting implemented but may need tuning for production
- No caching implemented for public key lookups

### Files Modified During Review

None - refactoring deferred due to architectural scope

### Gate Status

Gate: FAIL → docs/qa/gates/2.9-admin-authentication.yml
Risk profile: docs/qa/assessments/2.9-risk-20250918.md
NFR assessment: docs/qa/assessments/2.9-nfr-20250918.md

### Recommended Status

[✗ Ready for Done] / [✓ Changes Required - See issues above]
(Story owner decides final status - CRITICAL security fixes required before any deployment)
