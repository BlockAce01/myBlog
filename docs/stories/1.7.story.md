# Story 1.7: Frontend-Backend Integration

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to see the blog posts, comments, and likes on the website,
**so that** I can interact with the blog's content.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The frontend application fetches and displays a list of blog posts from the backend API.
2. Clicking on a blog post navigates to a detail page and displays the full post content, including comments.
3. Users can submit new comments, and they are successfully saved to the backend.
4. Users can like a post, and the like count is updated in the backend and reflected on the UI.
5. The view count for a post is incremented when a user visits the post's detail page.
6. All frontend components that interact with the backend are connected and fully functional.
