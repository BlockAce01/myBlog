# Story 1.7: Local Multi-Container Setup

## Status
New

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to create a docker-compose.yml file to easily run the entire full-stack application (frontend, all backend services, and a MongoDB database) locally with a single command (docker-compose up),
**so that** I can easily run and test the entire application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A `docker-compose.yml` file is created.
- The entire full-stack application can be started with `docker-compose up`.
- All services are accessible and working correctly.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create `docker-compose.yml` file.
- [ ] Task 2: Configure services in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- [ ] Task 3: Verify the application runs with `docker-compose up`.
