# Story 1.9: Security Hardening - Environment Variables

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to move sensitive database credentials from hardcoded values in docker-compose.yml to environment variables,
**so that** I can prevent credential exposure in version control and follow security best practices.

## Acceptance Criteria
- MongoDB URI credentials are removed from docker-compose.yml
- Credentials are stored in environment variables
- Application continues to work with environment-based configuration
- No sensitive data is committed to version control

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create .env file for local development
  - [ ] Define MONGODB_URI environment variable
  - [ ] Add .env to .gitignore
  - [ ] Document environment variable setup
- [ ] Task 2: Update docker-compose.yml
  - [ ] Remove hardcoded MongoDB URI
  - [ ] Reference environment variable
  - [ ] Ensure env_file is properly configured
- [ ] Task 3: Test configuration
  - [ ] Verify docker-compose up works with new configuration
  - [ ] Test database connectivity
  - [ ] Confirm no credential exposure in git

## Dev Agent Record
- Agent Model: dev
- Debug Log References:
- Completion Notes:
- File List:
  - `.env` (local development)
  - `docker-compose.yml` (updated)
  - `.gitignore` (updated)

## Dev Notes
### Security Requirements
- Never commit sensitive credentials to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Document setup process for new developers
- Consider using Docker secrets for production deployments

### Implementation Approach
1. Create `.env` file with MongoDB URI
2. Update `docker-compose.yml` to use `env_file` directive
3. Remove hardcoded credentials from docker-compose.yml
4. Update `.gitignore` to exclude `.env` files
5. Test the configuration works correctly

## Testing
1. Run `docker-compose up` with new environment configuration
2. Verify database connection works
3. Check that `.env` is not tracked by git
4. Confirm no sensitive data in docker-compose.yml
