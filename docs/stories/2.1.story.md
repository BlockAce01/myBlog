# Story 2.1: Auth Service & Admin User Model

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system administrator
**I want** an authentication service and user model for admin accounts
**so that** I can securely manage access to the admin interface

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Auth Service skeleton created in backend
2. Admin User model defined with fields: username, email, passwordHash
3. User model persisted in MongoDB
4. Basic CRUD operations supported for User model

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create Auth Service structure
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Create `/api/auth` directory
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Add auth router skeleton
- [x] Task 2: Implement Admin User model
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Define Mongoose schema
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Add password hashing middleware
- [x] Task 3: Connect to database
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Update db.js to include User model
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Add test connection

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
N/A (first story in epic)

### Data Models
Reference: `docs/architecture/4-data-models.md`
- Add User model:
  ```javascript
  {
    username: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
    email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
    passwordHash: { type: String, required: true },
    role: { type: String, enum: ['admin'], default: 'admin' }
  }
  ```

### API Specifications
Auth service will implement REST endpoints:
- POST /auth/register
- POST /auth/login
- GET /auth/me
(Implementation in future stories)

### File Locations
- Auth Service: `apps/backend/src/api/auth/`
- User Model: `apps/backend/src/models/User.js`

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for User model
- Integration tests for auth routes (future story)

### Technical Constraints
- Use bcrypt for password hashing
- JWT for authentication (future story)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-13

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid code quality with proper use of Mongoose schemas, bcrypt for password hashing with appropriate salt rounds (12), and clean separation of concerns. The auth service skeleton is minimal but correctly structured. No major issues found.

### Refactoring Performed

None required - code is well-structured and follows best practices.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows JavaScript/Node.js best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Adheres to unified project structure
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Unit tests implemented with in-memory MongoDB
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria are satisfied

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Consider adding input validation middleware for auth routes (future story)
- [ ] Add rate limiting for auth endpoints (future story)
- [ ] Implement password strength requirements (future story)

### Security Review

Password hashing implemented correctly with bcrypt and salt rounds of 12. No security vulnerabilities identified in this basic implementation.

### Performance Considerations

No performance issues identified. Password hashing is asynchronous and properly handled.

### Files Modified During Review

None

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/2.1-auth-service-admin-user-model.yml
Risk profile: N/A (low risk implementation)
NFR assessment: N/A (basic implementation)

### Recommended Status

✓ Ready for Done
