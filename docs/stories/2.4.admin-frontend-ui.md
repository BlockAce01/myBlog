4. Edit existing blog post functionality with pre-populated form
5. Delete blog post functionality with confirmation dialog
6. All admin routes protected by authentication middleware
7. Proper error handling and user feedback for all operations
8. Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile

## Dev Notes
### Technical Context
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication from Story 2.2
- **Backend APIs:** Protected endpoints from Story 2.3
- **Database:** MongoDB with BlogPost model from Story 1.3

### File Structure
- Admin pages: `apps/frontend/app/admin/`
- Components: `apps/frontend/components/admin/`
- Authentication: Reuse existing auth utilities
- API calls: Use existing API utilities with JWT headers

### Testing Standards
- Unit tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library
- Integration tests for admin workflows
- Test files location: `apps/frontend/__tests__/admin/`
- Mock authentication and API calls
- Test both authenticated and unauthenticated states

### Dependencies
- JWT token handling from Story 2.2 implementation
- Protected API endpoints from Story 2.3
- Existing UI components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
- Form validation library (if needed)

### Security Considerations
- All admin routes must require valid JWT
- Store JWT securely (localStorage with httpOnly consideration)
- Validate JWT on each admin page load
- Handle token expiration gracefully
- No sensitive data in client-side storage

## Testing
### Unit Tests
- Login form validation and submission
- Dashboard data fetching and display
- Blog post creation form
- Blog post editing form
- Delete confirmation dialog
- Authentication middleware

### Integration Tests
- Complete login flow (form → API → redirect)
- Blog post CRUD operations
- Authentication protection for admin routes
- Error handling for failed API calls

### E2E Tests
- Admin login and dashboard access
- Creating a new blog post
- Editing an existing blog post
- Deleting a blog post
- Mobile responsiveness
