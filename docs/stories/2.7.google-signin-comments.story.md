# Story: Implement Google Sign-In for Commenting

**Status**: Ready for Review

## Story

As a blog visitor, I want to sign in with Google so that I can comment on blog posts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users must authenticate with Google OAuth before submitting comments
- Anonymous commenting is disabled
- Comment form shows sign-in prompt for unauthenticated users
- After sign-in, users can submit comments with their Google account info
- Comments display the user's name from Google profile
- User details (name, email, Google ID) are stored in the user table upon first sign-in
- Sign-in state persists across sessions

## Tasks

- [ ] **Backend**: Add Google OAuth integration
  - [x] Install and configure Google OAuth library (passport-google-oauth20)
  - [x] Create new API endpoints for Google authentication (/auth/google, /auth/google/callback)
  - [x] Modify User model to support public users with Google ID, name, email, and profile picture
  - [x] Implement user creation/update logic to store Google profile data in user table
  - [x] Update comment API to require authentication and associate comments with authenticated users
- [ ] **Frontend**: Integrate Google Sign-In
  - [x] Install NextAuth.js for authentication handling
  - [x] Configure Google OAuth provider
  - [x] Modify comment form to check authentication status
  - [x] Add sign-in button and user profile display
  - [x] Update comment submission to include user token
- [ ] **Database**: Update Comment model
  - [x] Modify Comment schema to include userId reference
  - [x] Update comment queries to include user information
  - [x] Create indexes for efficient comment lookups

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights**: Story 2.6 implemented search functionality, no direct conflicts with commenting.

**Data Models**:
- Comment model currently has authorName (string), needs modification to include userId (ObjectId reference to User) [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models.md]
- User model exists for admin users, needs extension for public users with Google authentication [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models.md]

**API Specifications**:
- Current comment endpoints: GET /posts/:id/comments, POST /posts/:id/comments [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-specification-rest.md]
- Need to add authentication endpoints for Google OAuth [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-specification-rest.md]
- Comment submission will require JWT token from Google authentication

**Component Specifications**:
- Comment form component exists, needs modification for authentication check [Source: apps/frontend/components/comment-form.tsx]
- Need to add authentication components (sign-in button, user profile) [Source: docs/architecture/7-unified-project-structure-source-tree.md]

**File Locations**:
- Backend auth routes: apps/backend/src/api/auth/ [Source: docs/architecture/7-unified-project-structure-source-tree.md]
- Frontend auth components: apps/frontend/components/ [Source: docs/architecture/7-unified-project-structure-source-tree.md]
- Models: apps/backend/src/models/ [Source: docs/architecture/7-unified-project-structure-source-tree.md]

**Testing Requirements**:
- Unit tests for authentication middleware [Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- Integration tests for Google OAuth flow [Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- E2E tests for comment submission with authentication [Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]

**Technical Constraints**:
- Use JWT for session management [Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- MongoDB Atlas for user data storage [Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- Next.js 14+ with TypeScript for frontend [Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- Node.js with Express.js for backend [Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]

## Testing

- Verify Google OAuth authentication flow works correctly
- Test that unauthenticated users cannot submit comments
- Verify authenticated users can submit and view comments
- Test session persistence across browser sessions
- Validate comment display shows authenticated user names
- Test error handling for failed authentication
