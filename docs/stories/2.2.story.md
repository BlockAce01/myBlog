# Story 2.2: Implement Login & JWT Generation

**Status:** Done

**Story**
**As an** administrator,
**I want** to log in to the admin interface with my credentials and receive a JSON Web Token (JWT),
**so that** I can access protected backend management APIs and manage blog content securely.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1.  The Auth Service exposes a `/login` endpoint that accepts admin credentials (username/password).
2.  Upon successful authentication, the `/login` endpoint returns a valid JWT.
3.  The JWT contains necessary claims (e.g., user ID, role, expiration).
4.  Invalid credentials result in an appropriate error response (e.g., 401 Unauthorized).
5.  The Auth Service handles secure password verification (e.g., bcrypt).

**Tasks / Subtasks**
- [x] Implement `/login` endpoint in `apps/backend/src/api/auth/auth.js`
  - [x] Validate incoming username and password
  - [x] Verify password against stored hash
  - [x] Generate JWT on successful authentication
  - [x] Return JWT in response
- [x] Add necessary dependencies for JWT (e.g., `jsonwebtoken`)
- [x] Update `apps/backend/package.json` with new dependencies
- [x] Create unit tests for the `/login` endpoint in `apps/backend/src/api/auth/auth.test.js`
  - [x] Test successful login and JWT generation
  - [x] Test login with invalid credentials
  - [x] Test login with missing credentials

**Dev Notes**
- Relevant Source Tree info:
  - `apps/backend/src/api/auth/auth.js`: Main file for authentication logic.
  - `apps/backend/src/models/User.js`: User schema for admin user.
  - `apps/backend/package.json`: For adding JWT library.
- Important notes from previous story: Story 2.1 created the Auth Service skeleton and the User schema. This story builds upon that foundation.

**Testing**
- Test file location: `apps/backend/src/api/auth/auth.test.js`
- Test standards: Use Jest for unit testing. Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all authentication scenarios.
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use: Jest, Supertest for API endpoint testing.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-13

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation is well-structured and follows Node.js best practices. The code is clean, readable, and properly handles asynchronous operations. Error handling is appropriate with proper HTTP status codes and messages.

### Refactoring Performed
None required - the code is already well-written.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ Adheres to project standards
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows unified project structure
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with Jest
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Code quality is high with proper error handling
- [x] Security measures in place (bcrypt, JWT)
- [x] Test coverage is comprehensive
- [ ] Consider adding rate limiting for login endpoint (future enhancement)
- [ ] Add input validation middleware (future enhancement)

### Security Review
- Password hashing: ✓ Uses bcrypt with salt rounds 12
- JWT security: ✓ Uses environment variable for secret
- Input validation: ✓ Validates required fields
- No security vulnerabilities identified

### Performance Considerations
- Simple implementation with no performance issues
- Database query is efficient
- JWT generation is lightweight

### Files Modified During Review
None

### Gate Status
Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/2.2-login-jwt-generation.yml
Risk profile: Low - standard auth implementation
NFR assessment: All NFRs satisfied

### Recommended Status
✓ Ready for Done
