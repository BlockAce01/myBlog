# Story 2.3: Protect Backend Management APIs

**Status:** Done

**Story**
**As an** administrator,
**I want** the backend management APIs to be protected by JWT authentication,
**so that** only authenticated admins can create, update, or delete blog posts.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. All protected endpoints (POST, PUT, DELETE) require a valid JWT in the Authorization header
2. Requests without valid JWT receive a 401 Unauthorized response
3. The middleware validates JWT using the same secret as the Auth Service
4. The middleware extracts user information from the JWT and makes it available to endpoint handlers
5. Protected endpoints remain accessible to unauthenticated users for read operations (GET)

**Tasks / Subtasks**
- [x] Create authentication middleware in `apps/backend/src/middleware/auth.js`
  - [x] Verify JWT from Authorization header
  - [x] Attach user data to request object
  - [x] Handle invalid tokens and missing tokens
- [x] Apply middleware to protected endpoints in `apps/backend/src/api/posts.js`
  - [x] POST /posts
  - [x] PUT /posts/:id
  - [x] DELETE /posts/:id
- [x] Write unit tests in `apps/backend/src/middleware/auth.test.js`
  - [x] Test valid token
  - [x] Test invalid token
  - [x] Test missing token
- [x] Update existing tests for protected endpoints to include authentication

**Dev Notes**
- Relevant Source Tree:
  - `apps/backend/src/middleware/auth.js`: JWT authentication middleware
  - `apps/backend/src/api/posts.js`: Protected endpoints
  - `apps/backend/.env`: JWT_SECRET configuration
- Important notes:
  - Use the same JWT_SECRET as Story 2.2
  - Middleware should pass user info (userId, role) to route handlers
  - GET endpoints should remain public

**Testing**
- Test file location: `apps/backend/src/middleware/auth.test.js`
- Test standards: Use Jest and Supertest to simulate protected API calls
- Testing patterns:
  - Verify middleware rejects requests without valid tokens
  - Verify middleware allows requests with valid tokens
  - Verify user information is properly attached to requests

**QA Results**
**Review Date:** 2025-09-13
**QA Agent:** Quinn (Test Architect & Quality Advisor)
**Overall Assessment:** PASS ✅
**Risk Level:** Low
**Test Coverage:** Excellent (100%)

### Implementation Quality
- **Code Quality:** Excellent - Clean, well-documented, follows security best practices
- **Security:** Strong - Proper JWT validation, secure token handling, appropriate error responses
- **Architecture:** Good - Middleware pattern correctly implemented, consistent application across endpoints
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive - Handles all edge cases (missing, invalid, expired tokens)

### Test Coverage Analysis
- **Unit Tests:** 6 comprehensive middleware tests covering all scenarios
- **Integration Tests:** Protected endpoint tests verify authentication requirements
- **Edge Cases:** All error conditions properly tested
- **Coverage:** 100% of story acceptance criteria verified

### Acceptance Criteria Verification
1. ✅ All protected endpoints (POST, PUT, DELETE) require valid JWT
2. ✅ Requests without valid JWT receive 401 Unauthorized response
3. ✅ Middleware validates JWT using same secret as Auth Service
4. ✅ Middleware extracts user information from JWT and makes it available to handlers
5. ✅ Protected endpoints remain accessible to unauthenticated users for read operations (GET)

### Risk Assessment
- **Security Risk:** Low - Implementation follows JWT best practices
- **Performance Risk:** Low - Minimal overhead added to request processing
- **Reliability Risk:** Low - Comprehensive error handling and testing
- **Maintenance Risk:** Low - Clean, documented code with clear separation of concerns

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate:** Proceed with deployment to staging environment
2. **Short-term:** Add integration tests for complete auth flow (login → protected endpoint)
3. **Monitoring:** Implement auth failure logging in production
4. **Documentation:** Consider adding API authentication guide for frontend developers

### Test Results Summary
- Total Tests: 44 (across 7 test suites)
- Passing: 44
- Failing: 0
- Coverage: 100% of story requirements

**Gate Decision:** PASS - Ready for deployment
