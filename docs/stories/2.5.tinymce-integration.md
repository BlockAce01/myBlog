### User Story: Integrate TinyMCE Rich Text Editor for Blog Post Creation and Editing

## Status
Completed - QA Passed

As a blog author
I want to use a rich text editor with advanced formatting options
So that I can create and edit blog posts more effectively

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Use TinyMCE React component in new post and edit post forms
- [x] Toolbar must include: headings, bold, italic, lists, links, images, code blocks, and alignment
- [x] Implement image uploads via Postimages.org to avoid storing images locally
- [x] Ensure HTML content is properly sanitized before saving
- [x] Update character counting to ignore HTML tags for validation
- [x] Create reusable RichTextEditor component
- [x] Update post display to safely render HTML content
- [x] Maintain backward compatibility with existing Markdown posts

#### Technical Notes:
- Install packages: `@tinymce/tinymce-react` and `dompurify`
- Modify files:
  - Create `components/RichTextEditor.tsx`
  - Update `app/admin/dashboard/new/page.tsx`
  - Update `app/admin/dashboard/edit/[id]/page.tsx`
  - Update `app/post/[id]/ClientBlogPostPage.tsx`
- No backend changes required

#### Dependencies:
- None

#### Estimated Points: 5

#### Status: Completed

#### QA Results:
✅ **All Acceptance Criteria Met**
- TinyMCE React component properly integrated in both new and edit forms
- Complete toolbar with all required features (headings, bold, italic, lists, links, images, code blocks, alignment)
- Postimages.org image upload working correctly
- HTML sanitization implemented with DOMPurify
- Character counting excludes HTML tags as required
- Reusable RichTextEditor component created
- Safe HTML rendering with HTMLRenderer component
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing Markdown posts

⚠️ **Issues Found & Fixed During QA:**
1. **Critical Security Issue**: HTML content was not being sanitized before database storage
   - **Fix**: Implemented DOMPurify sanitization in RichTextEditor component
   - **Impact**: Prevents XSS attacks through malicious HTML content

2. **Poor User Experience**: No feedback for image upload failures
   - **Fix**: Created useImageUpload hook with toast notifications
   - **Impact**: Users now get clear success/error messages for image uploads

3. **Performance Issue**: Character counting used inefficient regex for large HTML content
   - **Fix**: Replaced with DOMParser-based solution for better performance
   - **Impact**: Significant performance improvement for large blog posts

#### Implementation Details:
- **Security**: DOMPurify sanitization applied before content storage
- **User Experience**: Toast notifications for image upload status
- **Performance**: Optimized HTML text extraction using DOMParser
- **Compatibility**: Hybrid renderer handles both HTML and Markdown content
- **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable code with proper error handling

#### Files Modified During QA Fixes:
- `apps/frontend/components/RichTextEditor.tsx` - Added sanitization and image upload hook
- `apps/frontend/hooks/use-image-upload.ts` - New hook for image uploads with feedback
- `apps/frontend/lib/html-utils.ts` - New utility for HTML processing
- `apps/frontend/app/admin/dashboard/new/page.tsx` - Updated character counting
- `apps/frontend/app/admin/dashboard/edit/[id]/page.tsx` - Updated character counting

#### Final Status:
- ✅ Build passes successfully
- ✅ All TypeScript checks pass
- ✅ Security vulnerabilities resolved
- ✅ Performance optimizations implemented
- ✅ User experience enhancements added
- ✅ Production-ready implementation
